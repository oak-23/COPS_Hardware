# Comprehensive Optimization & Purification System (COPS)

COPS is an integrated water quantity and quality management system for storage tanks that runs continuously in the background. It monitors, purifies, and redistributes water across connected tanks while intelligently managing volumes to handle shortages, surpluses, and contamination events. The result is a smart, climate‑ready water infrastructure layer that strengthens resilience against droughts, floods, and other extreme conditions.
